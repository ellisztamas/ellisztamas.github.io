I am an evolutionary biologist at the Gregor Mendel Insitute in the group of Magnus Nordborg.
I have worked on a variety of topics, but major themes have been exploring links between the effects of genes and how organisms interact with their environments, and developing novel approaches to deal with difficult projects.

This page gives details of the projects I have worked on, including links to the packages I have developed for R and Python.

The name "Ellisz Tam√°s" is not in fact my real name, but how it would be rendered in Hungarian. I started using it for online profiles when I married into a Hungarian family, and because there are already at least two Tom Ellises who are more famous than me who have already used up the usernames on websites.
