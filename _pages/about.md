I have worked on a range of topics in evolutionary genetics, but a common theme is investigating the link between genes and their environments in the relevant biological context.

1. Extensive experience in **data analysis** in R and Python. I place particular emphasis on ensuring my analyses are **reproducible** by myself and others. See, for example, code repositories accompanying publications on [fitness components] or [virus resistance] *Arabidopsis thaliana* (if you don't think these are reproducible, please let me know why and I will endeavour to improve this).
2. Strong background in **statistics**. Key to this is to start by identifying what the question to be answered is and tailoring the analysis to that, rather than the other way round. The work I have most enjoyed has been those where conventional approaches run into difficulty, and the way forward has come by approaching the problem from a different angle (for example in [speeding up paternity inference] or taking a quantitative, rather than categorical, approach to [investigating pleiotopy](https://github.com/ellisztamas/sintillate).
3. 
4. An emphasis on **careful experimental design**, because this saves a world of pain for all of the points above.

The name "Ellisz Tam√°s" is not in fact my real name, but how it would be rendered in Hungarian. I started using it for online profiles when I married into a Hungarian family, and because there are already at least two Tom Ellises who are more famous than me who have already used up the usernames on websites.
