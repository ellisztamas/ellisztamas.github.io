I have worked on a range of topics in evolutionary genetics, but a common theme is investigating the link between genes and their environments in the relevant biological context.

I would highlight four key areas of expertise I have gained:

1. Extensive experience in **data analysis** in R and Python. I place particular emphasis on ensuring my analyses are **reproducible** by myself and others.
<!-- See, for example, code repositories accompanying publications on [fitness components](https://github.com/ellisztamas/fecundity_components) or [virus resistance](https://github.com/ellisztamas/tumv_ms) *Arabidopsis thaliana*. -->
2. Strong background in **statistics**. Key to this is to start by identifying what the question to be answered is and tailoring the analysis to that, rather than the other way round.
<!-- The work I have most enjoyed has been those where conventional approaches run into difficulty, and the way forward has come by approaching the problem from a different angle (for example in [speeding up paternity inference](https://github.com/ellisztamas/faps) or taking a quantitative, rather than categorical, approach to [investigating pleiotopy](https://github.com/ellisztamas/sintillate). -->
3. Ample experience of planning, carrying out and harvesting **large-scale field experiments**.
4. An emphasis on **careful experimental design**, because this saves a world of pain for all of the points above.

The name "Ellisz Tamás" is not in fact my real name, but how it would be rendered in Hungarian. I started using it for online profiles when I married into a Hungarian family, and because there are already at least two Tom Ellises who are more famous than me who have already used up the usernames on websites.
