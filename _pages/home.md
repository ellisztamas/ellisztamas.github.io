I am a biolgist with a interest in evoutionary genetics, data analysis in R and Python, and eating well.
A particular interest is on the genetics of quantitative traits.

My analytical focus is on writing robust, reproducible code, and on designing experiments that make sure you don't run into trouble in the first place. I occasionally blog here about topics related to those things.

I mostly work on plants because they don't bite or run away, you can do what you like to them, and because they're delicious.

The name "Ellisz Tam√°s" is not in fact my real name, but how it would be rendered in Hungarian. I started using it for online profiles when I married into a Hungarian family, and because there are already at least two Tom Ellises who are more famous than me who have already used up the usernames on websites.
