I maintain several packages for R and Python related to analysing genetic data.

- **Fractional Analysis of Sibships and Paternity** (FAPS): a Python package to jointly infer paternal and sibling relationships using for large SNP datasets. See the github [repository](https://github.com/ellisztamas/faps) and [documentation](https://fractional-analysis-of-paternity-and-sibships.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html), which includes extensive tutorials, and the [accompanying paper](/assets/pdfs/2018_FAPS_paper.pdf).
- [sintillate](https://github.com/ellisztamas/sintillate): An R package for quantifying pleiotropy (the extent to which genes affect multiple traits).
- [arghqtl](https://github.com/ellisztamas/arghqtl): Tools for plotting and downstream analysis of R/QTL objects in R. It is intended in particular for cases where there are many QTL models to compare, and one's first thought about how to plot them is 'AAAAARGH!'.
