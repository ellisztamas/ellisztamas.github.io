I have worked on a range of topics in evolutionary genetics, but a common theme is investigating the link between genes and their environments in the relevant biological context.

I would highlight four key areas of expertise I have gained:

## Data analysis

- I have more than **10 years experience of using R and Python** for data analysis almost every day, including interacting with both Git and high performance clusters.
- The work I have most enjoyed has been those where conventional approaches run into difficulty, and the way forward has come by **approaching the problem from a different angle**. For example:
    - [Speeding up paternity inference](https://github.com/ellisztamas/faps)
    - Taking a quantitative, rather than categorical, approach to [investigating pleiotopy](https://github.com/ellisztamas/sintillate)
- A strong focus on **robust, reproducible code**. See for example:
    - Code repositories accompanying publications on [fitness components](https://github.com/ellisztamas/fecundity_components) or [virus resistance](https://github.com/ellisztamas/tumv_ms) *Arabidopsis thaliana*.
    - The R and Python [packages](/software/) I have written to support my research.

## Large scale field experiments

- I have gained ample experience of planning, carrying out and harvesting **large-scale field experiments**.
    - During my PhD I was involved and occasionally led a demographic survey of thousands of wild snapdragons, and designed and led a large-scale pollination assay in the field.
    - During my post-doctoral work on local adaptation in *Arabidopsis thaliana* I was respomsible for organising six reciprocal transpant experiments involving hundreds of thousands of plants in two countries.
- Key to this is an emphasis on **careful experimental design**:
    - In my current position investigating methylation variation we suspected that there was cryptic confounding affecting our bisulphite sequencing data. Thanks to careful blocking and randomisation I was able to isolate the problem and refine subsequent data collection.

## Leadership and mentoring

## Clear communication
